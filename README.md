### 1) Rock 🗿 Paper 🧻 Scissors ✂️

> Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

### 2) Weight Planet Calculator 🌍⭐🌙

> This program enables you to discover the weight of any object, even yourself, in any of the planets contemplated. Currently, available planets include: ***Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn***.

### 3) Whale Talk 🐋

> Take any given phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’. There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language: ***there are no consonants*** (only vowels excluding “y”) and ***the u‘s and e‘s are extra long***, so we must double them in our program.

### 4) Meal Maker 🥗🥩🧁

> This program will randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu.

### 5) Lodash Library 📚

> In this project, I have implemented some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular [lodash.js library](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

### 6) Credit Card Checker 💳

### 7) Mysterious Organism 🦠
[Link to code](https://github.com/iker-gonzalez/mini_projects_catalogue/blob/main/07_mysterious_Organism/mysterious_Organism.js)
> ***Project Goals***
**Context:** You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

### 8) Mixed Messages 💭🔴🔵🟢

> For this project, I have build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. I have made this program around three main pieces of data: [animals, verbs, adjectives]. Have some fun getting to know each animal!

### 9) Healthy Reciped 🥬  🌽  🥦

## 10) Magic 8-Ball 🎱
>The [Magic 8-Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-ball) is a super popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, developed in the 1950s!

Our program will output a random fortune each time it executes.

## 11) Harry Potter Sorting Hat ♠︎♣︎♥︎♦︎
>“A thousand years or more ago,
>When I was newly sewn,
>There lived four wizards of renown,
>Whose names are still well known.”

The [Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts) welcomes you! First-year students must go through the annual Sorting Ceremony.

The Sorting Hat is a talking hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to:

- Gryffindor
- Hufflepuff
- Ravenclaw
- Slytherin

The program asks the user some questions and places them into one of the four Houses based on their answers!
