### 1) Rock 🗿 Paper 🧻 Scissors ✂️

> Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

### 2) Weight Planet Calculator 🌍⭐🌙

> This program enables you to discover the weight of any object, even yourself, in any of the planets contemplated. Currently, available planets include: ***Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn***.

### 3) Whale Talk 🐋

> Take any given phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’. There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language: ***there are no consonants*** (only vowels excluding “y”) and ***the u‘s and e‘s are extra long***, so we must double them in our program.

### 4) Meal Maker 🥗🥩🧁

> This program will randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu.

### 5) Lodash Library 📚

> In this project, I have implemented some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular [lodash.js library](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

### 6) Credit Card Checker 💳

[### 7) Mysterious Organism 🦠](https://github.com/iker-gonzalez/mini_projects_catalogue/blob/main/07_mysterious_Organism/mysterious_Organism.js)

> ***Project Goals***
**Context:** You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.
