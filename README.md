## Rock 🗿 Paper 🧻  Scissors ✂️
Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

<strong>The possible outcomes are:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Rock destroys scissors.</li>
  <li>Scissors cut paper.</li>
  <li>Paper covers rock.</li>
</ul>

If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
