### 1) Rock 🗿 Paper 🧻 Scissors ✂️
> Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

### 2) Weight Planet Calculator 🌍⭐🌙
> This program enables you to discover the weight of any object, even yourself, in any of the planets contemplated. Currently, available planets include: ***Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn***.

### 3) Whale Talk 🐋

> Take any given phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’. There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language: ***there are no consonants*** (only vowels excluding “y”) and ***the u‘s and e‘s are extra long***, so we must double them in our program.

## 4) Meal Maker 🥗🥩🧁

> This program will randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu.
