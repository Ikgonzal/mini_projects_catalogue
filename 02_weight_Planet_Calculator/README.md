# Weight Planet Calculator 🌍⭐🌙

Though an object’s mass remains consistent throughout the universe, **weight is determined by the force of gravity on an object**. Since different planets have different gravity, the same object would weigh different amounts on each of those planets! Cool, huh?

This program enables you to discover the weight of any object, even yourself in any given planet. Currently, available planets include:
